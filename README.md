# sliding-Sign-Signup-form
a sliding sign IN/UP form


**Project description**!
Before we move to the actual code, I'd like to break down the things we're going to have in the component. This will help as it will make the code we write much clearer.

We have 4 smaller screens/boxes inside the main component (the .container):

The Sign In form
The Sign Up form
The Sign In overlay
The Sign Up overlay
Also, at one moment in time you can see either:

The Sign In form alongside the Sign Up overlay
The Sign Up form alongside the Sign In overlay
In the overlay panels we have some text and a button - by clicking it you will bring up the other combination of screens and vice-versa. Check the GIF above one more time to see what I mean.
